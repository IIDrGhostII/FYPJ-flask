# Flask Question

This repository contains a practice question for building a simple web application using the Flask framework.

## Question

Implement a web application using Flask that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) blog posts. The application should have the following features:

1. **Create a new post**: Users should be able to create a new blog post by providing a title and content.
2. **List all posts**: The application should display a list of all existing blog posts on the home page.
3. **View a post**: Users should be able to view the details of a specific blog post by clicking on its title in the list.
4. **Update a post**: Users should be able to edit the title and content of an existing blog post.
5. **Delete a post**: Users should be able to delete an existing blog post.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new virtual environment and install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `app` directory and implement the necessary routes, models, and templates to fulfill the requirements of the question.
4. Write test cases in the `tests` directory to verify the functionality of your application.
5. Run the Flask application locally and test the CRUD operations for blog posts.
6. Commit your changes and push them to the remote repository.

## Folder Structure

- `app/`: This directory contains the Flask application code, including routes, models, templates, and static files.
- `tests/`: This directory contains test cases for the Flask application.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the required Python packages and their versions for the project.
