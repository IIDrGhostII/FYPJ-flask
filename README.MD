# Flask Project Repository

This repository contains a collection of Flask application projects designed to promote teamwork and collaboration using Git and GitHub. Each project focuses on a different set of features and functionality, ranging from simple to complex implementations.

## Projects

1. **Simple Todo App**
   - A basic Flask application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete todo items.

2. **Contact Form**

   - An application for managing recipes, categorizing them, searching, and creating shopping lists.

5. **Online Learning Platform**
   - A full-featured online learning platform with course management, student enrollment, discussion forums, and instructor/student dashboards.

Each project has its own directory with a dedicated `README.md` file, containing detailed information about the project requirements, instructions for setting up and running the application, example code snippets, and the project folder structure.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory you want to work on.
3. Follow the instructions in the project's `README.md` file to set up the development environment, install dependencies, and run the Flask application locally.

## Collaboration

This repository is designed to facilitate teamwork and collaboration between students or developers. Each project can be worked on by two or more individuals, allowing them to practice Git workflows, branching strategies, code reviews, and merge conflict resolution.

Here's a recommended collaboration workflow:

1. One team member creates a new branch for a specific feature or task.
2. The team member implements the changes and commits them to their branch.
3. The team member pushes their branch to the remote repository and creates a pull request.
4. Other team members review the code changes, provide feedback, and suggest improvements through the pull request.
5. After addressing any comments or resolving conflicts, the pull request is merged into the main branch.
6. Repeat this process for each new feature or task, ensuring that all team members collaborate effectively.

By following this workflow, students will gain valuable experience in collaborative software development, communication, and teamwork.
